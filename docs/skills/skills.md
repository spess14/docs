# Entity Skills

TC14 has no jobs like Captain, Engineer, Doctor and so on. Instead, skill system is used, which describes what the user can do well or does badly.

There are 8 main skills, each is responsible for an area in the game.
## Skills
### Ranged
Ability to throw items with malicious intent or shoot with ranged weapons.
### Melee
Ability to fight in close quarters: pushing, whacking someone with a crowbar or a similar weapon, or other martial arts.
### Excavating
Ability to recognize valuable minerals, operate mining or excavating machinery, or getting items from mining stuff.
### Botanics
Ability to grow crops, analyze certain mutations, and make new types of growables. Yes, including weed.
### Handling
Ability to interact with animals efficiently: not getting attacked by a bear, getting tons of milk from a cow and fishing.
### Creation
Ability to create: either crafting items or building things.
### Medical
Ability to heal wounds, perform surgery, work with implants.
### Research
Ability to invent and develop new things: researching using bluebench or R&D setup, for example.

## Skill Interactions
Each skill is a number between 0 and 20. For each level, there is also a certain number of development points you need to invest into it to get to the next level.

From the start of the game, you cannot have a skill above level 10. Starting skills are determined via combination of backstories and weighted random rolls.

Skills are mostly meant to follow these rules:

- Skills are flexible, but not too much; if you choose to play as a doctor with handling as a hobby, you're supposed to stick to it - this is how you made your character, after all.
- Skills should not allow you to be all-capable - everyone has things that they can or cannot do. Skills encourage to request help from other players with certain things.
- Skills do not lock you out of a game area completely - even someone with 0 melee skill should be able to fight, although ineffectively. Likewise, all skills are supposed to (at most) make the task harder instead of completely blocking that task (unless this task is something advanced).

## Roundstart Skills (kinda technical)
First, a player chooses a backstory. A backstory contains passions for certain skills - for example, Laboratory mouse Experimentator will have Research+++;Handling+. A player can pick up to 2 backstories, but some conflict with others.

After that, a player has a list of passions for skills, for example: Research+++;Handling++;Melee+ for backstories Laboratory Mouse Experimentator, Animal Bully.

Each skill with a triple passion will have at least level 4, and each skill with a double passion will have at least level 2. Amount of guaranteed skill points given that way cannot exceed 10 - if you somehow get triple passion in 3 skills, you will only get guaranteed level 4 for 2 skills and guaranteed level 2 for 1 skill.

At the start of the round, you will get 25 skill points minus guaranteed skill points randomly assigned to all of your skills. For each passion in a skill, you get +1 weight to getting a skill point in that skill. For example, with triple-passion research, you are four times as likely to get a skill point for Research as a skill point for Shooting. Again, you cannot exceed level 10 from that; if you gain Research 10 and you still have skill points to be distributed, they will go to other skills.

## Development points
Development points are a replacement for XP system; instead of XP, you get either free-choice development points or development points that automatically go to a specific skill.

Development points for a level-up is ROUNDUP((CURRENTLVL+1)/2).

To get development points, you can read books, complete certain achievements in skills, or just do the activity associated with the activities.

## Development falloff

At max, a person can have 160 skill points. At roundstart, a person has 25-30 skill points.

With every skill point, you get a +0.85% chance to not gain any development points from any source. This means that the absolute maximum of skill points is 118~=120, out of 160.
