# Species Design

TC14's design regarding species is very different from SS14. There is way less focus on balance and more focus on introducing interesting features.
However, balance is still important. In general, all species must have this design principles:
- No matter your species, you should still have access to all core mechanics and most of the minor mechanics. Limitations are fine, complete bans usually aren't.
- Species shouldn't just be decorational - markings exist for that. Each species must have something that makes it different from others.
- Species are supposed to have both upsides and downsides - no xenotype should be "human but better/worse". View it as a trade-off - exchanging downsides for upsides.

## Human

Humans are the baseline for all species. They only have one upside:

- Humans get +15% learning rate.

## Dwarf

Dwarves are mining and crafting specialists. They are small, long-living species.

Misc:

- Dwarf maximum age is 400.

Upsides:

- Dwarves are immune to alcohol poisoning. They gain nutrition from alcoholic beverages.
- Dwarves can see in the dark.
- Dwarves get +2 to Crafting and Mining.

Downsides:

- Dwarves receive way less nutrition from regular food.
- Dwarves have less mass than a regular human - that means easier pushing against them, etc.
- Dwarves receive twice as much slowdown from cold temperatures.

## Lizard

Lizards are heat-loving folk.

Upsides:

- Lizards have a tail; it allows you to drag things around with busy hands, but it applies more slowdown in that case.
- Lizards deal slash instead of blunt with unarmed attacks.

Downsides:

- Lizards can only eat fruits and meat.
- Lizards prefer higher temperatures than usual.

## Slime Person

Slime people are quite flexible to rough environments (except cryoguns, I guess).

Misc:

- Slime people breathe nitrogen instead of oxygen.

Upsides:

- Slime people can regenerate injuries and replenish their "blood" by burning nutrition.
- Slime people have a 2x3 internal storage available to everyone.
- Slime people suffocate way slower.
- Slime people take less cellular damage.

Downsides:

- Slimes take more pressure damage.
- Slimes take more cold damage; cold damage also stops their regeneration completely.
- Slimes take damage on contact with water (only externally - consuming water is still needed).

## Moth

Moth.

Upsides:

- Moth can fly in no-gravity environments.
- Moth can tolerate colder temperatures.
- Moth ignore most of the terrain slowdown effects.

Downsides:

- Moth can only gain nutrition from cloth.
- Moth are very flammable and take more heat damage.

## Arachnid

Spider people. Very handy folk.. haha get it?

Upsides:

- Arachnids have 2 extra "pockets".
- Arachnids can produce silk at the cost of nutrition.
- Arachnids can eat raw meat without any problems.
- Arachnids deal pierce instead of blunt with unarmed attacks.

Downsides:

- Arachnids suffocate way faster.
- Chocolate and onions are poisonous to them.
- Arachnid blood is metabolized from copper instead of iron.
- Arachnids are vulnerable to psychic damage.

## Diona

Dionas are literally sentient plants.

Upsides:

- Dionas can turn into a nymph on death, allowing them to reform into a new body in 10 minutes. This comes with a skill loss.
- Dionas have slowed down metabolism when exposed to sunlight.
- Dionas bleed sap and bleed out way slower.
- Dionas get +2 to Handling and Botanics.

Downsides:

- Dionas cannot wear shoes.
- Dionas are very flammable and take more heat damage.
- Receiving a certain amount of heat damage can ignite diona.

## Vox

Vox are a bit hard to make right in a planetary environment.

Upsides:

- Vox deal slash instead of blunt with unarmed attacks.
- Vox get +2 to melee.
- Vox screams can induce fear in people around, reducing their combat capabilities.

Downsides:

- Oxygen is poisonous to vox. They have to wear the N2 filter on their back; without it, they will die.
